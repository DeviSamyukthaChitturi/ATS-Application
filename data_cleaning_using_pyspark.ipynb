to be disclosed) in Macau.I need to segment the customers who visit their property based on the value the patrons bring into the company.Basically prove that the segmentation can be done in much better way than the current system which they have with proper numbers to back it up.Henceforth they can implement target marketing strategy to attract their customers who add value to the business.
